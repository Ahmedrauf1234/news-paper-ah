        ndustrial design is a process of design applied to physical products that are to be manufactured by mass
        production.[1][2] It is the creative act of determining and defining a product's form and features, which takes
        place in advance of the manufacture or production of the product. It consists purely of repeated, often
        automated, replication,[3][4] while craft-based design is a process or approach in which the form of the product
        is determined by the product's creator largely concurrent with the act of its production.[5]

        All manufactured products are the result of a design process, but the nature of this process can vary. It can be
        conducted by an individual or a team, and such a team could include people with varied expertise (e.g.
        designers, engineers, business experts, etc.). It can emphasize intuitive creativity or calculated scientific
        decision-making, and often emphasizes a mix of both. It can be influenced by factors as varied as materials,
        production processes, business strategy, and prevailing social, commercial, or aesthetic attitudes.[3]
        Industrial design, as an applied art, most often focuses on a combination of aesthetics and user-focused
        considerations,[6] but also often provides solutions for problems of form, function, physical ergonomics,
        marketing, brand development, sustainability, and sales.
